# Marijuana-Study---NHANES-
Research on the effects of Marijuana consumption on Mental and Physical health.

This project explores the relationship between marijuana consumption, body mass index (BMI), and mental health conditions using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The primary objective is to investigate whether marijuana use is associated with significant changes in BMI and the prevalence of mental health disorders within the surveyed population. The dataset includes demographic information, health indicators, and detailed data on marijuana usage.

Python was used for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization. Key statistical techniques such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and group comparisons were employed to understand the differences between marijuana users and non-users. Descriptive statistics, including mean BMI values and mental health condition rates, were calculated for both groups. The project aims to provide insights into the public health implications of marijuana consumption by analyzing its impact on physical and mental well-being.
